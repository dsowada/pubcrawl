\section{Modules}

The following Python modules are planned for use in the implementation:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{requests} -- to call the Overpass API and obtain raw JSON data
          describing bars in the Regensburg Altstadt.
    \item \textbf{json} -- to parse the API responses into Python objects.
    \item \textbf{pandas} -- to clean and organise the bar data in tabular form
          and to perform filtering and feature engineering.
    \item \textbf{geopy.distance} -- to compute distances between latitude/longitude
          coordinates (e.g., between user and bars, or between different bars).
    \item \textbf{networkx} -- to model the bars as a graph and to compute
          shortest or near-shortest paths for the pub crawl.
    \item \textbf{folium} -- for displaying the ideal route from bar to bar
\end{itemize}

It is possible that the modules here will differ at the end of the project, because the
implementation process did not finish. All changes will be added to the final assignment.
