\section{Introduction}

The goal of this project is to develop a \textit{Pub Crawl Recommendation Application}
for the city centre of Regensburg (Altstadt). Users provide their current location,
the number $k$ of bars they want to visit, and optional preferences. The preferences
depend on the quality of data input from the API's and is not certain yet. There will be 
some evaluation criteria consisting of the distance from your location to the bar, the opening hours, 
food choices or bar type (e.g., sports bar, student bar, dance bar, karaoke bar, jazz bar). 
The system generates an optimised route that visits $k$ suitable bars in an 
walking distance, depending on the recommendation scores.

This document explains how I intend to solve the problem in terms of the
\textbf{algorithm}, \textbf{tools}, \textbf{modules} and \textbf{data structures}
used in the implementation.
